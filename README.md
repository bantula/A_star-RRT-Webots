My friend and I have worked on a project about comparing RRT* and A* algorithms in PFE. Unfortunately, we didn't finish it.

While we were working on it, we made a simulation for that algorithm.

We left it at the point where you could enter set of points and robot will go from one point to another by truning and walking exact distance.
